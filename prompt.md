# Prompt

## Start Here

Measured 2026-10-07 from each open issue's blockers (`gh api repos/shanedolley/jira-mgr/issues/<n>/dependencies/blocked_by`).

1. **C4 HTTP client (#12)**: unblocked once C3 (#11) merges. Build on `getCredentials()` from `@jira-mgr/core/auth`; keep the https Atlassian host check.
2. **C9 ADF and Markdown (#17)**: unblocked; C1 (#9) merged.
3. **C5 field resolution (#13)**: needs C4.

## Reading Order

1. [handover.md](handover.md), then this file.
2. [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and [docs/standards/](docs/standards/README.md).
3. [docs/product/roadmap.md](docs/product/roadmap.md), the [product grilling record](docs/discovery/2026-10-07-product-grilling.md) and the [ADRs](docs/adr/README.md).

## Loop

1. `git fetch` and read what changed in the handover files and `AGENTS.md`.
2. Claim the next unblocked issue: comment the branch, add `status:in-progress` through `kothar:project-manager`.
3. Cut a branch from `origin/main`. Read the issue and every file it touches.
4. Build the smallest change that meets the criteria, with its test.
5. Run `pnpm format:check && pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test && pnpm build`, plus `pnpm e2e` for desktop work. Read the pass and fail counts. Commit locally and have a reviewer other than the builder pass it before pushing, since a green PR may merge at once.
6. Run `/autonomous:update`, so the handover lands in the story's commit.
7. Commit with `Refs #n`, push, open the pull request, watch CI with `gh pr checks <n> --watch`.
8. On green CI, merge (Shane's standing rule in his global instructions), then clean up the branch.
9. Comment on the issue how each criterion is met; have `kothar:project-manager` set `status:ai-review`.

## Decision Format

Comment on the issue: the question, each option with its cost and what it buys, a recommendation with its reason, and what happens on each answer. Then have `kothar:project-manager` set `status:hil-review`.

## Not Alone

- Any write to live Jira (PSAPAC): creating, editing, transitioning or deleting issues, comments, worklogs, links or attachments. Tests never write. L7's live smoke check needs Shane present.
- Merging a Dependabot major version bump.
- Code signing, notarisation, or anything that costs money.
- Changing an accepted ADR's decision; write a new ADR instead.

## Skills

- `verification-before-completion` before claiming any criterion met.
- `architecture-decisions` for a decision that is hard to reverse, surprising and a real trade-off.
- Design docs for L1, D2 and D4 from `docs/templates/design-doc.md`, before their code.
- `impeccable` and `frontend-design` for Desktop UI work.
- `writing-clearly-and-concisely` rules for every doc, commit and comment.
